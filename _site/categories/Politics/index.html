              Political Violence.
            </a>
          </h3><p>It’s incredible the kind of sanitized version of activism Americans believed existed before the modern day. Unions and Suffragettes started fires and planted bombs. They engaged in civil disobedience and had to be ready to defend themselves against both fellow citizens and police. In the Civil Rights movement, the Freedom Riders and lunch counter sit-ins were all violating local law, and defending themselves when brawling did break out was not unheard of. In one of the clearest through lines from violence to results, the gay rights movement didn’t start getting taken seriously until they started throwing bricks at cops.</p>

            </a>
          </h3><p>In recent weeks, people have been critiquing the film Dunkirk for its lack of portrayal of colonial soldiers during the evacuation of British forces from France in 1940. This is certainly not without merit; British infantry was not segregated by race, with soldiers from the Caribbean serving in the Infantry alongside soldiers from the British Isles themselves. Ultimately the film focuses on three (and a half, exposition squirrel Branagh) narratives. It does not intend to be an all-encompassing view of the battle. Still, this criticism does bear weight, particularly in light of what virtually every other narrative of the Second World War leaves out.</p>
