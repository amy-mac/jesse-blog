    <p>First and foremost, let us say that the premature loss of any human life is a tragedy. Even the lowest and basest of us do not deserve violent ends. What follows is not a judgment on the officers who lost their lives in Dallas last night. Make no mistake, those men deserved to go home to their families and live good, long lives.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, across America you’ll hear the clarion call of, “why don’t people protest when police officers are murdered?” Well, because actual protests are really not necessary. What do I mean by that?</p>

<p>Here in Oakland, a rapist killed two police officers during a traffic stop, then two more when a SWAT team came to apprehend him. But what happened after is a key difference: tens of thousands, from around the country, came to mourn the fallen officers. Their community, regardless of race, mourned them in a profound outpouring of grief. Trust funds were set up for their children. Their loss was felt by most Americans, regardless of race or creed.</p>

<p>True, there was a “protest” held for the perpetrator. It attracted 60 people. Sixty. Compared to tens of thousands from every neighborhood in Oakland, and around the nation.</p>

<p>When a Black man is shot by the police in the United States, tens of thousands of people will come willing to perform character assassination on the victim, willing to denigrate the witnesses to their murder, and willing to cast everything they were into the gutter, all without even knowing them. Regardless of what transpired, regardless of who they were as a human being, and being entirely unwilling to concede that a life, a precious and irreplaceable thing, was lost.</p>

<p>When a police officer is shot, everyone but a few unbalanced extremists will come and eulogize them as a person who did not deserve to be lost.</p>

<p>I don’t believe that anyone deserves a violent end. So of course, Blue Lives Matter, and All Lives Matter. Who would argue otherwise?</p>

<p>But I will nevertheless continue to give my full and active support to those who argue that Black Lives Matter. Because right now, in the status quo, in today’s America, it is the lives of Black people who can meet violent ends and will have piteously few to speak for them. No one to ensure the prosperity of their family.</p>

<p>These officers in Dallas did not deserve to die. There is no equivocation. Their killers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. They will receive a eulogy from every prominent political figure in America. They deserve it.</p>

<p>But my activism, my active voice, must go to the people who die cold and alone. The marginalized. The people whose killers go unpunished. The people who have no man to read their eulogy. Those whose cries of “I can’t breathe” go unheeded by the dozens of people around them.</p>

<p>I value all life. I believe all murder is wrong. But right now, the chronic, sustained, unanswered, absence of justice that America faces is that of black people being extrajudicially killed, with no justice being done to their killers.</p>

<p>Let us extend justice and safety to everyone.</p>
