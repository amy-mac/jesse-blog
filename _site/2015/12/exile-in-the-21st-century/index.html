    <p>Ostracism was a procedure under the Athenian democracy in which any citizen could be expelled from the city-state for ten years. Each year the Athenians were asked in the assembly whether they wished to hold an ostracism. Citizens gave the name of those they wished to be ostracised to a scribe, and they would vote.

<p>The British government began transporting criminals to overseas colonies in the 17th century. After the American Revolution, an alternative site was needed to avoid further overcrowding of British prisons and hulks. Due to the continent’s isolation, Australia was considered ideal for a penal colony, and in 1787 the First Fleet of eleven convict ships set sail for Botany Bay. Several other penal colonies were soon established. Many of the convicts were transported for petty crimes; others were political prisoners. From 1810, convicts were seen as a source of labor to advance and develop the British colony.</p>

<p>The term Sybirak generally refers to all people resettled to Siberia. In 19th century Russia, criminals and political radicals were often sent to labor camps in Siberia as punishment. Although prisoners in tsarist Russia completed manual labor and faced beatings, many still managed to live relatively productive lives during their sentences. The Soviets would also used exile as punishment. In the early days of the Soviet Union, a system of concentration camps was created known as the GULAG, where prisoners labored in mining, forestry, or building infrastructure like roads. The gulags quickly became infamous for their harsh treatment of prisoners.</p>

<p>What am I getting at here?</p>

<p>I think this is a blueprint for what we should do to people who post spoilers for the new Star Wars movie.</p>

<p>We exile them from the Internet for a period of no less than five years, and sentence them to a period of labor cleaning the toilets in Tomorrowland closest to Star Tours.</p>
