              Black Anger and History.
            </a>
          </h3><p>In 2013, Phil Robertson said of Black people in the South in the 1950s, “They’re singing and happy,” and denied that any racial animus bothered them. Now that race is dominating headlines, once again a plethora of white people seem to be claiming that black anger is a recent phenomenon. This is certainly not the case.</p>

            </a>
          </h3><p>First and foremost, let us say that the premature loss of any human life is a tragedy. Even the lowest and basest of us do not deserve violent ends. What follows is not a judgment on the officers who lost their lives in Dallas last night. Make no mistake, those men deserved to go home to their families and live good, long lives.</p>

              Merrick Garland.
            </a>
          </h3><p>I’m tickled that people, particularly some on the left, actually think that Merrick Garland is some kind of ideal Obama pick. Yes, in the past the normal process for this process was that a President would make a nomination, and if the nominee was reasonably competent, the Senate would approve. Yes, it would be ideal to break as many glass ceilings as we can. If Obama actually expected Garland to be approved, he would indeed be a poor choice. But I’d argue that it is extremely unlikely that Garland will eventually be nominated.</p>

              The film adaptation of The Prisoner of Azkaban is better than the book.
            </a>
          </h3><p>The writing of the Harry Potter series becomes more sophisticated as the books progress. It starts with <em>Philosopher’s</em> and <em>Chamber</em>, which are written for a younger audience. The themes are relatively simple. Then in <em>Azkaban</em>, J.K. Rowling seems to decide that she wants to be more ambitious with the series. The introduction of Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, and Remus Lupin make the characters’ relationship adds a complexity to the mythology of Hogwarts that hadn’t been present in the previous two books. Further, it ends with very large plot threads unresolved. The narrative dividing line between books begins to be blurred, instead of most of the plot resolving at the end of each book. Finally, the series starts to take a more thematically complex turn, pushing the boundaries of “Young Adult” literature by <em>Phoenix</em>.</p>
