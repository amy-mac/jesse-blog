<p>With the forthcoming release of Black Panther, I’ve been excitedly reading through the prominent titles and and writers who have defined T’Challa over the past 50 years. While my survey has yet to be completed, I can provide a decent overview for people fascinated by the character and are interested in learning more about him.</p>

              Charlottesville, Dunkirk, and &quot;The Good War&quot;
            </a>
          </h3><p>In recent weeks, people have been critiquing the film Dunkirk for its lack of portrayal of colonial soldiers during the evacuation of British forces from France in 1940. This is certainly not without merit; British infantry was not segregated by race, with soldiers from the Caribbean serving in the Infantry alongside soldiers from the British Isles themselves. Ultimately the film focuses on three (and a half, exposition squirrel Branagh) narratives. It does not intend to be an all-encompassing view of the battle. Still, this criticism does bear weight, particularly in light of what virtually every other narrative of the Second World War leaves out.</p>

            </a>
          </h3><p>The writing of the Harry Potter series becomes more sophisticated as the books progress. It starts with <em>Philosopher’s</em> and <em>Chamber</em>, which are written for a younger audience. The themes are relatively simple. Then in <em>Azkaban</em>, J.K. Rowling seems to decide that she wants to be more ambitious with the series. The introduction of Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, and Remus Lupin make the characters’ relationship adds a complexity to the mythology of Hogwarts that hadn’t been present in the previous two books. Further, it ends with very large plot threads unresolved. The narrative dividing line between books begins to be blurred, instead of most of the plot resolving at the end of each book. Finally, the series starts to take a more thematically complex turn, pushing the boundaries of “Young Adult” literature by <em>Phoenix</em>.</p>
