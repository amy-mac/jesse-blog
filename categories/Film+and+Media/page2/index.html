          </h3><p><em>The problems with the _Star Wars</em> Prequels go beyond the dialogue and the directing. They shunt the vast majority of the actual story into <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>. As a result, the first two films feel empty, and <em>Episode III</em> feels incredibly rushed. This is my attempt to redress that._</p>

          </h3><p>Last Thursday I showed my class Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog. We’ve reached a point where it is truly part of the superhero geek subculture. In my four years of teaching, only a scant three students have ever seen it before. I stick to it, because it serves as an excellent teaching tool to get students to look for elements of Realist, and Formalist film styles.</p>

              Rules for a new Star Wars Expanded Universe
            </a>
          </h3><p>Let’s take off the rose colored glasses. Most of the Star Wars Expanded Universe was of questionable quality. It succeeded at the time because it had the charm of 1) being <em>Star Wars</em> and 2) we were all fourteen. By the time the haphazard Bantam era was over, Del Rey took over the license and there was some modicum of editorial oversight. But there were still some significant problems: the main characters were in their 60s, the Empire was feeling very tired as a villain, and the continuity was severely disjointed. This led to the <em>New Jedi Order</em> era, which presented a number of questionable creative decisions itself. The characters were denied any kind of “happily ever after” ending, and consigned to one masochistic character spiral after another.</p>

            </a>
          </h3><p>I’ve gotten to the point where I basically check out of any show that uses sexual violence as a plot device. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a serious topic that needs to be addressed in our art and in our culture. But far too often, it’s used to cheaply give gritty backstory to a female character, or worse, provide dramatic motivation to male characters.</p>

          </h3><p>I think being interested in media is a bit like being a car enthusiast. People like me are quite content to just let their cars take them places, and can appreciate how they look on the outside. But a decent chunk of people want to do more than that: they want to pop that hood and see how the engine works. Maybe they want to participate with the process more, and might fiddle with the engine. And the people who REALLY get into it might proffer suggestions of how to get it to run better, or look nicer.</p>

              Toys
            </a>
          </h3><p>A perfect metaphor for the problems our media faces is that: what sections in toy stores are like. We have large swaths of the toy store that are coded as acceptable for boys; the LEGOs, the basketballs, the trains. Here’s where you find the chemistry sets and anything relevant to professions and careers. Yet there’s the narrow section that is relegated to girls. It is awash in pink, and the large majority of it relates to domesticity right out of the 1950s. But here’s the thing. It is socially acceptable, indeed often encouraged, for the girls to go into the “boys section.” Because, good luck finding a telescope in that sea of fuchsia. Or God forbid that she wants to play with a LEGO set that’s not a café. Yet most people, even in California, in spite of their liberal pretensions, react with such strident opposition when a boy decides that he wants a pink baking set.</p>
