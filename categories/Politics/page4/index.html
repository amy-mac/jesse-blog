Now frankly, none of these have sat entirely right with me. So here’s what I’m going to do: I’m going to vet each Captain for the position of President, and each First Officer for the position of Vice President.</p>

Yes, in the past the normal process for this process was that a President would make a nomination, and if the nominee was reasonably competent, the Senate would approve. Yes, it would be ideal to break as many glass ceilings as we can. If Obama actually expected Garland to be approved, he would indeed be a poor choice. But I’d argue that it is extremely unlikely that Garland will eventually be nominated.</p>
