    <p>Given the massive amount of shit in the shape of an Oompa Loompa on the debate stage, there was not as much policy on stage as their should have been. So here’s why I’m voting for Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with her opponent. If you think that “flawed” is somehow going to factor into this analysis, <a href="http://jessemackinnon.com/2016/07/belief-hatred-and-the-democratic-primary/">I have a few choice words for you</a>.</p>

<h2 id="health-care">HEALTH CARE</h2>

<p>Clinton has staked much of her professional life on this issue. She believes in single payer, though has touted adding a much needed Public Option to Obamacare to complete it as legislation, and giving people the ability to get health care from a source other than a predatory insurance company.</p>

<h2 id="infrastructure">INFRASTRUCTURE</h2>

<p>Shit is broke. <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-makes-a-big-push-on-infrastructure-1470433942">She wants to fix it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="taxes">TAXES</h2>

<p>The inevitable question is, “how are you going to pay for it?” Well lets examine America. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/21/the-top-10-of-americans-own-76-of-the-stuff-and-its-dragging-our-economy-down/">Income and wealth inequality is really bad</a>.</p>

<p>According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, here is what Clinton would do: “Hillary Clinton proposes raising taxes on high-income taxpayers, modifying taxation of multinational corporations, repealing fossil fuel tax incentives, and increasing estate and gift taxes. Her proposals would increase revenue by $1.1 trillion over the next decade. Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes.”</p>

<h2 id="racial-justice">RACIAL JUSTICE</h2>

<p>She has a <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/why-black-voters-dont-feel-the-bern-213707">long history of Civil Rights activism</a>.</p>

<p>She has seriously detailed plans of how to address it. Seriously, <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/racial-justice/">follow the links</a>, particularly on Criminal Justice Reform.</p>

<h2 id="campaign-finance-reform">CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM</h2>

<p>This time, it’s personal. The “Citizens United” case is what opened up the flood gates of unlimited money into our political process. Well, the Citizens United organization was independently releasing material attacking Hillary Clinton. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-campaign-finance_us_57e45147e4b0e28b2b532700">So she has a vested interest in this</a>.</p>

<h2 id="womens-rights">WOMEN’S RIGHTS</h2>

<p>Uh, hello.</p>

<h2 id="education">EDUCATION</h2>

<p>Hell, her college shit has been done to death. But getting less headlines is her plan to expand free Preschool for all Americans. Both in improving long term outcomes for kids, and in financial relief for working families, this is huge.</p>

<hr />

<p>And all of this just scratches the surface. This is what’s important to me. If you need to know anything else, just go to her site. Clinton is a technocrat with a <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/">fairly sizable amount of concrete policy proposals</a>.</p>

<p>But you know what? Policy issues are only a third of what makes a good President. And frankly, if Republican intransigence continues unabated, not all of these will come to pass. Yet this is only a part of her appeal.</p>

<p>Presidents have to manage the day to day task of running the Government. Clinton has had a front row seat for this as First Lady, and as Secretary of State. She in unequivocally the most qualified person to hold this job that has ever run for the office.</p>

<p>Presidents are the Head of State as well as the Head of Government. Clinton has proved time and again her clear demonstrations of strength and equanimity. She would be a good representative for the American People.</p>

<p>In 1993, shortly after her father died, she gave an extensive interview with the New York Times in which she opened up about her faith and her world view. They bestowed the ensuing article with the sneering title “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/magazine/saint-hillary.html?pagewanted=all">Saint Hillary</a>,” and the nation mocked her for her sincerity. But here’s how the article opened:</p>

<p>“Since she discovered, at the age of 14, that for people less fortunate than herself the world could be very cruel, Hillary Rodham Clinton has harbored an ambition so large that it can scarcely be grasped.</p>

<p>“She would like to make things right.”</p>

<p>I’m with her. And she’s with us.</p>
