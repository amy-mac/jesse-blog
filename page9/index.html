          </h3><p>I’ve gotten to the point where I basically check out of any show that uses sexual violence as a plot device. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a serious topic that needs to be addressed in our art and in our culture. But far too often, it’s used to cheaply give gritty backstory to a female character, or worse, provide dramatic motivation to male characters.</p>

This society, after having produced a great deal of material wealth by exploiting its own natural resources, still faced a profoundly unequal society, filled with a tiny ruling monarchy and elite ruling vast numbers of poor, uneducated people. That underclass left when they could, spreading out and forming a vast diaspora. Many times, this diaspora met local traditions, political institutions and customs with bloodthirsty savagery, unmitigated violence the likes of which the world has scarcely seen since.</p>

In short, it is a “discussion” about women’s roles in online spaces, that more often than not takes the form of death threats.</p>
