Every year, an average of 1,300 Americans are killed due to domestic violence. 93% of the perpetrators are male.

Every year, an average of 33,000 Americans are killed with handguns. 85% of the perpetrators are male.

Every year, an average of 2 Americans are killed by a Muslim immigrant. 96% of the perpetrators are male.

If Donald J. Trump is serious about singing out specific demographics to prevent violent death in the United States, I would like to hear his plan on how to tackle the problem of Men.
