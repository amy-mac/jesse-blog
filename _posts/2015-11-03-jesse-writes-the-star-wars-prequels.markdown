_The problems with the _Star Wars_ Prequels go beyond the dialogue and the directing. They shunt the vast majority of the actual story into _Revenge of the Sith_. As a result, the first two films feel empty, and _Episode III_ feels incredibly rushed. This is my attempt to redress that._

_Further, George Lucas's decision to foreground the tragic story of Anakin Skywalker, yet also include slapstick humor and a multitude of puns has led to some fairly severe tonal inconsistency. An alternate way to rewrite the Prequels and lighten the tone might be to make Anakin Skywalker a secondary character, who in the end betrays his friends. Yet I'm opting to retain many significant story decisions made by Lucas; at their core there is a good story behind the Prequels, and I will attempt to retain them._

_I'm aware that this telling is rather dark. But keep in mind what has to happen by the end of the Prequels. The collapse of a civilization. The genocide of a religion. And the tragic mistakes of a few people that allowed it all to happen._

### Episode I - A Knight Rises


23 year old Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi is on a mission with 23 year old Senator Padmé Amidala. There is clear romantic chemistry between them. They are on a mission to Geonosis to negotiate with the Trade Federation, headed by a young and charismatic former Jedi, and hopefully avert a Galactic Civil War. However, they quickly discover a military buildup, and are shot out of the sky.

They take refuge with a slave family... The Skywalkers. They live a hard life making parts for the Trade Federation's Droid Army. Owen is mild mannered, but 18 year old Anakin is a dynamic, charismatic, and skilled young man who could have gone far if he had not been born a slave.

Kenobi, Amidala, and Anakin begin planning a slave revolt. So instead of a Ben Hur pastiche, the film is a loose adaptation of Spartacus. Owen remains reluctant; he wants to simply keep his head down and escape the system.

However, at the midpoint of the film, our heroes they discover that the newly declared Confederacy are creating... clones. They're building a clone army, much superior to droids. The charismatic former Jedi reveals himself as Darth Tyranus, and nearly kills Obi-Wan before Anakin saves him.

In a pitched battle, Kenobi, and Amidala, and the Skywalkers escape the planet with as many slaves as they can transport. In the course of the battle with newly born Clone Troopers, Anakin's mother is killed. This causes Anakin to fly into a rage, battering the bodies of the Troopers off the walls.

They travel to [otherplanet.txt], and alert the Republic at Coruscant. Chancellor Palpatine is awarded emergency powers. Our heroes start to cobble together a last minute defense; the Republic has an extremely limited standing army and starships.

As a sign of how desperate things are, Anakin is thrown into a starfighter, with Obi-wan as his wingman. While the climactic battle is won, it was but a single prong of a carefully planned offensive across a thousand systems.

Owen wants a quiet life, and no part in war, and departs to the far reaches of the Galaxy. Anakin storms out of the room crying, and Owen tells Kenobi that he’s headed to Tatooine if his brother ever comes to his senses.

At the end of the film, we see a shadowy meeting between Darth Tyranous and Palpatine. Everything is going as planned.

### Episode II - The Fall of the Republic


5 years later. The Republic has taken serious losses, and the draft around the galaxy to fill the ranks of the Army of the Republic has taken its toll. Similarly, the ranks of the Jedi are strained, with Anakin Skywalker being a newly minted Jedi Knight.

The film opens with a pitched battle on [exoticplanet.txt], where the depth of their friendship is demonstrated.

Anakin has begun a secret relationship with Amidala, who is serving as the Chancellor's right hand man. When not in combat, there is palpable tension between Anakin and Kenobi as Kenobi and Amidala are sent to [distantplanetname.txt] on a mission to aid the war effort. Anakin is sent on a similar mission with the Chancellor.

Obi-Wan and Padmé are hard at work raising an army and buttressing political support. But in their stressful, spartan lifestyle, they are drawn closer together. Kenobi tries to seduce Amidala on their mission, but she demurs, saying that she's pregnant; Kenobi is the only person she's told.

Meanwhile, Anakin and Palpatine's Star Destroyer comes under attack by Confederate forces, they are boarded, and their ship is commandeered. Palpatine and Anakin hide in the Engineering section, and are only able to survive because of Palpatine's guidance. He impresses upon Anakin to embrace his passion when using the Force.

This leads to a big set piece battle at the end, a major turning point of the war. The army that Kenobi and Amidala were able to raise comes and rescues Palpatine and Anakin. In a final battle with Darth Tyranus, Anakin willingly gives into the Dark Side for the first time, easily besting and killing the man who was responsible for his slavery and the death of his parents.

Kenobi and Yoda are disturbed at how Anakin killed the Sith, and Anakin is convinced that Kenobi and Amidala have had an affair.

Palpatine is able to weave all his political machinations together, and use the crisis to declare himself nearly unlimited war powers. The film ends with Anakin and Palpatine meeting again. Anakin kneels before Palpatine.

### Episode III - Revenge of the Sith


1 year later. The film opens with a big set piece battle that is the final collapse of the Confederacy.

But in spite of his instrumental role... again... Anakin is snubbed by the Jedi Council, and not declared a Master. He quits the order in disgust, opting for his position in the Army of the Republic entirely, and therefore in Palpatine's inner circle.

The council fears him, and their increasingly hostile relationship with the Emperor. Yoda, sensing their power and importance, has sent Amidala and the 6 month old twins into hiding.

But there comes a crisis: Palpatine refuses to relinquish his War Powers. Some Jedi take it upon themselves to kill Palpatine and restore Democracy. But with Anakin's willing aid, they deal with them handily. Palpatine issues Order 66, as most Jedi have yet to demobilize from their units.

The massacre occurs, but Kenobi has escaped from his unit. Anakin leaves for [volcanoplanet.txt] to hunt him down. He finds Kenobi in hiding... with Amidala and twins that he never knew existed. Enraged, they duel. Anakin meets his downfall, burning alive, but Kenobi cannot deliver the coup de grace and kill Anakin; the planet is swarming with the new elite Stormtrooper Corps, and Kenobi rushes away. The troops stabilize Anakin, and take him back to Coruscant.

Yoda, having failed to challenge the Emperor himself (this happens offscreen), meets with Kenobi on Geonosis. They are both severely wounded.

Amidala, having been separated from Kenobi, travels incognito and looks for him on the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Mace Windu has managed to hold out against the Republic Army. Bail Organa sneaks in with her, hoping to somehow rescue the some of the Jedi. But the siege begins anew. A figure garbed in black steps out after a lull in the fighting, and demands single combat with the "Last Master of Coruscant." The man in black doesn't have the full Vader armor yet—it's a mostly patchwork of life support equipment, with only one or two familiar pieces. His heavily scarred eyes are still visible. Mace Windu steps forward and ignites his lightsaber.

Cut to: Yoda and Kenobi visibly reel as they feel his death.

Anakin finds Amidala in the temple. She pleads with him to wait, to listen, but is cut down before she can get anything else out. He steps over to the twins. We see his brow furrow. He looks over to Bail Organa cowering in the corner. "Take Kenobi's bastards and go."

The survivors opt to bide their time, and wait for the fledgling resistance to take form. Bail and Kenobi go and do their Harry Potter things.

Palpatine pronounces Anakin as Darth Vader, and reveals his ultimate plan for Sith supremacy: a hologram of the Death Star.
