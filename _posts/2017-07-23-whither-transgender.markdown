I assure you, you've shared a bathroom with a transgender person before. Having essentially "lost" the gay marriage issue, the GOP decided that they needed to weaponize more bigotry, and decided to start making this their new battleground.

If you really think that signs on the door were some kind of impediment to sexual predators before these laws, you're a fool. If you're worried about women and kids being groped, uh, look who just signed that Executive Order, gang.

And if you've spent any amount of time preoccupied with the status of the genitalia of the person in the stall next to you, I hate to break it to you, but you're the real pervert.

I've known many Trans folks in my life. They've been my friends, my colleagues, and yes, I have indeed dated people who were Trans. They're normal. The law needs to recognize that fact.
