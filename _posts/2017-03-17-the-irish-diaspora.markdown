On this day when millions of people celebrate the Irish diaspora in America, it's worth reflecting on the circumstances surrounding their departure from Ireland. During the "famine," there was more than enough food being grown to feed everyone, but it was being exported to fetch a better profit.

People refer to the "potato famine," but that's really a way for people to paper over the fact that the economic system that we still currently use accelerated one of the greatest calamities of the 19th century. It's a way that lets people avoid thinking about the fact that the people with economic power can and do let people starve en masse so they themselves can have a few more little numbers on their balance sheet.

Think about that in relation to our own ruling party's budget. Who are they willing to let starve? And who stands to gain?
