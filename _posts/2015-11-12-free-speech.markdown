When I was a teenager, one of the political issues that most occupied my heart and mind was that of Free Speech. When I pored over my History textbooks, I read over every governmental intrusion into free and open discourse with rapturous attention. I pilloried John Adams for the Alien and Sedition acts before I ever learned the nuances of his Presidency, and I looked on Lincoln with a new skepticism when I learned of his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. Both the Red Scares of the 20s and 50s outraged me, and I appreciated with newfound ardor on local history, seeing the Free Speech battles of the 60s and 70s.

In retrospect, I think the issue of Free Speech meant so much to me was because I had a passion for Progressive causes, and having my speech censored was the worst thing I could realistically imagine happening to me. As a white, heterosexual, middle class male going to High School in one of the most affluent towns in California, I was immersed in the local Liberal tradition, but was demonstrably removed from the active struggles of the people living just a few miles away. Alienation is a common feeling in teens and young adults, and the concept of not being heard by your peers or by authority figures is anathema to your very sense of self.

In college, these concerns largely fell by the wayside. It seemed fairly clear that most books were banned in small towns, and quickly overturned when they reached any kind of court. With the passage of the USA Patriot Act, the real threat to liberties seemed to be coming from the criminal justice system. And as I aged and met more people from backgrounds different from mine, my bubble of privilege was popped, and I realized with increasing clarity that racism was still an active factor in our society.

In the past year, discourse on college campuses, most particularly when it comes to “Political Correctness,” has come to the forefront of the national conversation. However, this is a long running battle in the American Culture Wars. From the [New York Times on May 5, 1991](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/05/us/political-correctness-new-bias-test.html):


<blockquote>On many campuses, in a climate that encourages non-traditional studies of the works of women and minorities and non-European cultures, faculty members who favor the teaching of traditional Western history and thought say they have been labeled politically incorrect. They have complained of a new kind of intolerance: a McCarthyism of the left.

What has come to be called ‘political correctness,’ a term that began to gain currency at the start of the academic year last fall, has spread in recent months and has become the focus of an angry national debate, mainly on campuses, but also in the larger arenas of American life. Abhorrent Tools, Worthy Goals?

As defined by its critics, political correctness is a widespread tendency to use censorship, intimidation and other weapons abhorrent to the American political process to support popular demands for measures to enforce sexual, racial and ethnic equality.”</blockquote>


However, the term has always been fairly transparent. From a [New York Times Editorial, published on April 17, 1991](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/17/opinion/editorial-notebook-politically-correct-false-slogan.html):


<blockquote>Conservatives have successfully established the phrase as a term of ridicule for even honorable liberal ideas. Now commentators and journalists carelessly invoke it at every turn: when it is suggested that racial, sexual or religious epithets are beyond the bounds of civility; when a political party chastens a member; when, Heaven forfend, there is discussion of teaching something other than Western history in civilization courses. Critics of art, pop culture and even opera throw the term around in their reviews.

Slogans are the habitat of small minds. ‘Politically correct’ impoverishes discourse more than most. It seeks to reduce all differences of opinion to a single one: the difference between liberals and conservatives. And since the term equates liberalism with intellectual tyranny, the argument is closed before the issues are ever joined.

The fever about political correctness first struck in the academic world, where it is often claimed that liberal orthodoxies have won the day by intimidation. Politically correct administrators are said to be banishing conservative scholars; imperiling Western culture by fawning on Papuan and Zulu studies; flooding colleges with unqualified black students; brainwashing collegians with abject pacifism.</blockquote>


However, I believe there is a simpler definition. I prefer the [Chrome Extension](https://twitter.com/BananaKarenina/status/630024374804942848) which replaces “Political Correctness” with “Treating People with Respect.” Or, for an even simpler version, “human decency.”

And being offensive towards someone doesn't also humiliate, harass and if not get someone fired, drive them to quit their job?](http://jessemackinnon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2014-10-24-1071offend.png)](http://jessemackinnon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2014-10-24-1071offend.png) [Via Wondermark](http://wondermark.com/1k71/). And being offensive towards someone doesn't also humiliate, harass and if not get someone fired, drive them to quit their job?[/caption]

What many people mistake for college students trying to silence or police speech, is actually free speech in itself. People on the left use their own speech to mock others’ speech. It may be distasteful to many Conservatives, but that's what free speech is all about: say whatever you want, and then what you choose to say is open to criticism of any kind, from any person.

The very notion of Society is that humans constantly police each other to enforce mutual standards of conduct, including speech. That’s not the modern world, that is simply the consequence of two or more humans living in proximity to each other. In centuries past it was acceptable to belittle and dehumanize basically most of humanity that wasn’t your own social group—or to be stubbornly naive towards how your actions affected them.

When people talk about something being “offensive,” they don't mean it just “hurts their feelings.” They mean that it demonstrably makes their lives harder by continuing ideas about them or their culture that are objectively wrong in some critical way. It isn’t objecting to an idea. It is objecting to abject misinformation. This misinformation can result in “harm,” from outdated terminology said in good faith in the more benign forms, to targeted violence in extreme circumstances.

Sure, People of Color, Women, or LGBT people do have their feelings hurt by these comments or actions. But the real issue isn’t “bad feelings,” it is the fear that the “offensive” thing will have real-world, external effects on their livelihood. By this metric, saying “offense is never given, always taken,” looks increasingly cowardly and anti-critical. Lambasting “Political Correctness” is a way of refusing to look at the implications of an action, and a denial of how culture impacts us as a society.

In this blog post, I’m going to examine some of the major cultural events of the last year that has informed this national dialogue on “Political Correctness.” I hope to demonstrate that in most circumstances, incidents that have gone viral have been taken wildly out of context, or ideas have been misrepresented, to suggest a climate of intellectual stifling where one doesn’t actually exist.

## Yale


This was started by a polite email asking people to not be jerks.

From the original email from the [Intercultural Affairs Committee to Yale Students on October 30, 2015](http://pastebin.com/TLGSdaTg):


<blockquote>“In many cases the student wearing the costume has not intended to offend, but their actions or lack of forethought have sent a far greater message than any apology could after the fact. There is growing national concern on campuses everywhere about these issues, and we encourage Yale students to take the time to consider their costumes and the impact it may have.”</blockquote>


To be perfectly clear: this isn’t a mandate. It isn’t a rule. It’s a non-binding email asking people to respect each other. Simple civility.

This led to the generally tone deaf reply by Erika Christakis. [It can be read in full here](https://www.thefire.org/email-from-erika-christakis-dressing-yourselves-email-to-silliman-college-yale-students-on-halloween-costumes/).

What’s telling is how the media has described it. The Daily Caller states that she was “…criticizing efforts at the school to censor Halloween costumes…” It boggles the mind how anyone could infer censorship in the original email.

Christakis and her husband Nicholas were excoriated by both students and colleagues. Her meandering email implies that there’s some sort of value in letting students piss each other off with racial insensitivity. And what’s even worse, she never actually explains what that educational value is.

[caption id="attachment_215" align="aligncenter" width="300"][![What would be the educational value in making someone tell this guy that he's a jerk?](http://jessemackinnon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mad-men-300x169.png)](http://jessemackinnon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mad-men.png) What would be the educational value in making someone tell this guy that he's a jerk?[/caption]



[caption id="attachment_216" align="aligncenter" width="300"][![Should Party City start selling this as a Halloween costume?](http://jessemackinnon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jew-grab-money-kinky-hair-hooknose-grin-300x249.gif)](http://jessemackinnon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jew-grab-money-kinky-hair-hooknose-grin.gif) Should Party City start selling this as a Halloween costume?[/caption]

Should it be entirely incumbent on individual People of Color to call out racism? They see it every day in our culture. Most of my Black students that I talk to have stories about being profiled. Why is it so onerous to suggest that they get some institutional support in colleges _**asking**_ people not to do it?

There’s a larger trend going on here that extends well beyond what is being reported in the media. [According to a current student at Yale](https://medium.com/@aaronzlewis/what-s-really-going-on-at-yale-6bdbbeeb57a6):


<blockquote>For starters: the protests are not really about Halloween costumes or a frat party. They’re about a mismatch between the Yale we find in admissions brochures and the Yale we experience every day. They’re about real experiences with racism on this campus that have gone unacknowledged for far too long. The university sells itself as a welcoming and inclusive place for people of all backgrounds. Unfortunately, it often isn’t.</blockquote>


Indeed, [as Joshua Cox and Sharifa Love documented in the Yale Daily News in 2007](http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2007/11/01/white-yalies-in-blackface-reveal-racism-on-campus/), Blackface is not an uncommon phenomenon at Yale Halloween parties. (For anyone generally unfamiliar with Blackface or why it's insulting, I would strongly recommend that you read the linked article.)

I don’t understand how Christakis can remotely see the email as a free speech issue, particularly in light of the fact that the inclusivity of Yale as a community has come under serious question before.

Of course, students have called for Nicholas Christakis to step down as the Master of Silliman College—pointedly not to step down as a teacher. To clarify, Yale is organized into a number of "residential colleges". These colleges do not offer classes, but rather serve as the basis for the social life for students there. As an analogy, think of each college at Yale as a dormitory at a smaller institution.

The professor that was being yelled at is the "master" of the college that she lives at. In our analogy, they would be like a residence hall director. In the video that went viral, the student did not say that "college is not about creating an intellectual space... It's about creating a home here". What she said was that his job as master is about creating a home there. And, frankly, it is. His job as a master of the residential college is about creating a home for the students who reside in the college.

What’s happening at Yale is free speech in action. Anyone can call on anyone else to do anything. Why is questioning someone’s performance at their job somehow more onerous than dressing up as a racial caricature?

## Rutgers


Why is it that people tend to use “reason” as an excuse to excise all empathy from their thinking at the expense of people not like them?

In Reason.com’s article [“Rutgers to Students: No Such Thing as 'Free' Speech, We Are Watching You, ‘Think Before You Speak,’”](http://reason.com/blog/2015/08/24/rutgers-to-students-no-such-thing-as-fre) they postulate that Rutgers will soon become an “Orwellian” nightmare, with students being encouraged to report incorrect thinking. Yes, they do actually use this phrase.

But there’s a big problem here. The web site took the quote out of context. The “Bias Prevention Committee” may sound invasive, but they’re really just using “Bias” as a way to describe a borderline hate-crime. From the Rutgers site, which “Reason” somehow quotes, but manages to misinterpret:


<blockquote>Bias Acts Are:
Verbal, written, physical, psychological acts that threaten or harm a person or group on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, ancestry, disability, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, atypical heredity or cellular blood trait, military service or veteran status.</blockquote>


Further, “Reason,” like many online news sites, leaves out any shred of context.

In 2010, [Tyler Clementi](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/02/06/the-story-of-a-suicide) had sex in his room. Unbeknownst to him, his roommate filmed the encounter, sharing it with other people on their floor. After bullying ensued following the incident, Tyler committed suicide.

In 2011, [Robert Palmer](http://interrogatingmedia.com/2015/07/10/why-i-no-longer-eat-watermelon-or-how-a-racist-email-caused-me-to-leave-graduate-school/) received a series of emails from a member of his graduate cohort, where White students were invited to eat watermelon and watch Song of the South. People of Color were excluded. This culminated in Palmer being pressured out of his program. The student who sent the original racist emails remained in the program.

These are simply the incidents at Rutgers that have made the national news. So again, there are demonstrable harms that have made themselves manifest, where students have been harmed based on their race or sexual orientation. And yet, the right-wing blogs that have swooped in can only make grim predictions of what might happen. Further, these predictions of the “thought police” are based on a profound misreading of he University’s policy.

## The University of Missouri


Once again, after students take action against racist incidents, the bogeyman of Free Speech is invoked. Nobody at Mizzou is demanding that speech be censored. They are reminding that there are consequences to your speech, and if someone wants to criticize your speech, they can.

This whole thing is the culmination of racist incidents followed by either no response from administration, or the response of the President amounting to telling the minority students that they were responsible for systemic racism because "they wouldn't believe that they have the equal opportunity for success" instead of the result of [real reports of racist incidents in a short period of time](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/10/racial-justice-advocates-university-of-missouri-won) provided by minority students.



	
  * The black president of the student union had racial slurs shouted at him from a passing vehicle.

	
  * A swastika was drawn on the wall of a restroom in human feces.

	
  * A muslim woman was called a terrorist and harassed for wearing a head covering.

	
  * A white college student got up on stage at a rehearsal for a black campus organization's homecoming court and starting shouting racial slurs.

	
  * Two black female students reported a group of 4 white men calling them racial slurs.

	
  * Most importantly, the repeated calls by minority students and student organizations, including Black, Muslim and Jewish students, to address harassment by the overwhelmingly white student population and the administration's refusal to acknowledge or respond to any of it.


On top of his indifference to the racism, Wolfe was on thin ice due to his treatment of grad students. He cut the health insurance they were provided by the University the day before it was scheduled to go into effect, leaving the grad students 24 hours to scramble to find other insurance.

But once again, “Free Speech advocates” decided that they would rather discuss a cameraman being harassed instead of the systemic racism on the campus, or the general ineptitude of the administration.

## “The Death of Free Speech on College Campuses”


In their March 18, 2015 article, “Reason” again postulates that “the first Amendment is in peril.” Let’s sample their evidence.



	
  * UC Irvine Student Government - a private association at a public university, whose action was actually vetoed by the leadership of that private association, and would only have applied to that association's offices.

	
  * George Washington University Student Government - a private association at a private university, undertaking an action applicable only to its members, which in any case amounted to attending a training session.

	
  * LSU - some random student saying she thought something should be banned.

	
  * University of Oregon - anecdotal episode regarding some protestors allegedly stealing the sign of another protestor.


This does not spell out a First Amendment “in peril.” The First Amendment provides that "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech." Under the 14th Amendment, the 1st amendment is also applicable to states, which is to say that public universities do have some obligations to refrain from prior restraint—the only kind of activity that the 1st amendment was originally understood to ban—or punishing free speech after the fact.

Whatever these examples portend for the amorphous “climate of free speech” on campus, they do not "[im]peril" the First Amendment. Only the first and second examples even involve the imprimatur of the university itself, and only the first deals with a public university, and in that case nothing actually happened. As for the fourth one, unless the police are willfully not protecting you because of the content of your speech, the First Amendment does not protect you from someone yelling at you. That is actually pretty much the opposite of what it does.

[caption id="attachment_220" align="aligncenter" width="566"][![Defending a position by citing Free Speech is the ultimate concession.

As in many such articles, the author is apparently mad that, in some quarters, the debate over free speech on campus is not going as they want, and rather than convince students that American flags are good and the LGBT sensitivity training is bad, they would prefer to imply that the Constitution absolutely protects speech even where no government action is implicated.

## Trigger Warnings


Another contentious issue on college campuses are that of “Trigger Warnings.” Somehow, it is postulated, letting students know if their course will contain distressing material will somehow be stifling to open discourse.

Yet in our society, we give content advisories all the time.

Consider: Rated R for Nudity and Sexual Violence

Or in its internet iteration: NSFW/NSFL, or even Spoiler Alert.

We alert audiences about distressing content all the time. Why is calling it a “Trigger Warning” so suddenly onerous?

Some Faculty argue that there needs to be more robust mental health services on campus, [instead of the burden falling exclusively on Professors](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2014/05/29/essay-faculty-members-about-why-they-will-not-use-trigger-warnings):


<blockquote>PTSD is a disability; as with all disabilities, students and faculty deserve to have effective resources provided by independent campus offices that handle documentation, certification, and accommodation plans rather than by faculty proceeding on an ad hoc basis.</blockquote>


Yet no one is asking Professors to be the sole line of defense in the mental health of their students. They are being asked to provide their students with a tool.

In 2008, I took a film class at SMC. A fellow student was a Vietnam Veteran who had seen combat. Before each class, he would ask the Professor if there was any intensely violent content in a film. Ultimately, he opted out of a screening of Once Were Warriors due to the intense domestic violence in the movie. I don’t think his brief conversations put any pressure on the Professor, nor did it alter the experience of the class for the rest of us.

Most Professors I encountered at DVC and UCLA had been using the same syllabus, unaltered, for decades. Perhaps they’re more afraid of taking the fifteen minutes it would take to add a few paragraphs about the content of the course? Or perhaps they’re fatalistic and know that their students won’t read the syllabus anyways…

## “The Coddling of the American Mind”


[This is it](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/). The big one, that was passed around and heavily discussed on social media. Ironically, the article is doing the very thing it complains about—catastrophizing. The authors jump from a few examples of students being very sensitive to “threat to American democracy” in the course of one article.

There are a lot of things wrong with this article, not the least of which is the fact that it was written by Greg Lukianoff, the CEO of FIRE, a group that ostensibly functions as a "free speech" organization, but whose real and stated aim is to combat "liberal faculty" and social justice themes in academia.

To address the general sentiment of the article, I think students have been led to believe that their opinions matter and that what they feel is really important, irrespective of context or quality of their arguments. But frankly, I don’t see how this is new. When I was in college, there were no shortage of know-it-alls who would talk about Greek Fire ships when we were discussing the Second World War. All to frequently, I was that know-it-all.

People have strange blind spots. Students might give their “feelings” about GMOs or organic food as if it were critical thinking. But ultimately, that is the purpose of a College education. It is the job of a college-level instructor to be take self-centered high school kids and turning them into educated and discerning adults.

When that general attitude of “my feelings are important” applies to young activist students, perhaps sometimes they feel that their outrage alone should command respect, as if they are being noble simply by expressing themselves. And I should know, I was one of those shocked and outraged students. The difference is, I didn’t have social media to broadcast myself.

Yes, there are certainly rare instances where this line of thinking has manifested as students demanding not to be exposed to “offensive” materials or people or ideas, and the authors seem obsessed with that point. I don't think that is a new phenomenon at all. Information sharing is just better, so we hear about these most extreme examples of students asking to be sheltered from potentially offensive things. And groups like FIRE drone on and on about it to make us all seem like we're catering to the most extreme students. The article is merely emphasizing this aspect of things in order to dramatize the situation and generalize about most college kids. But it's especially malicious because the authors wrap that phenomenon into mental health and tie it to things like self-reported anxiety.

Students today are reporting higher levels of anxiety relative to earlier periods because students today likely are experiencing higher levels of anxiety. I don't think it's that we're coddling them more as a society and inflating their emotions, as the authors seem to want to convey. College tuition is higher than ever, proportionally more students are taking on bigger debts and working longer hours to pay for education. Housing costs also have jumped up in many college towns, too. I know I was feeling stressed in school just working as an RA on top of classes.

Sorry, but students do have a reasonable expectation of physical and emotional security, even if their opinions are challenged or if their feelings get hurt by arguments of others. It is the job of instructors to identify the dynamic of the classroom and respond appropriately to avoid classroom lessons or discussion turning into an emotional assault on one student or group. There are very productive ways that you can have conversations in class about difficult subjects, and I think most competent instructors know how to navigate that.

Likewise, I think administrators have a similar responsibility. Is an alleged rapist football or TV star really a good choice for a commencement speaker at a campus where many women have been victims of rape? Is an anti-gay activist with a big following really a good person to invite to speak on campus during pride week? How about a person who has made a career of bashing a particular religious or ethnic group? These examples are perhaps ridiculous, but this generally is the sort of thing that groups of students have campaigned against—as well as the fact that university funds are going toward these prospective speakers.

So it's not simply speakers with different political philosophies that are being targeted by radical oversensitive students. And yet that's how it's presented. And while 240 of these campaigns against public speakers in the last 15 years seems super high, that's across thousands of colleges, and very loosely defined. At best, it's a tiny fraction of colleges that even experience those attempts to get rid of planned speakers, and of those, only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of speakers each year are targeted. Is this really a nightmarish epidemic striking college campuses?

## “I'm a liberal professor, and my liberal students terrify me”


This is another article that gained a great deal of traction in the last few months. [While the headline is sensationalist, the rant that ensues is entirely unrelated](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8706323/college-professor-afraid). Schlosser talks about how he won’t stand up for his beliefs because of “the system,” yet poorly defines how it has negatively affected him. And ironically, this article is entirely based on the kind of “politics of personal testimony” that the text condemns!

This author had one complaint in 2009. It was from a Conservative student. It resolved in his favor without much difficulty. Yet the rest of the piece is a straw man argument about what he thinks *might* happen in 2015. Worse, I'm not sure he was fully in the right in 2009. Although I am certainly in the author's camp politically, his telling of the incident makes it sound like he shut down a dissenting voice with an appeal to authority: “most experts would disagree with you, isn't it good that this one video I showed you tells you what to believe?". That’s not a great way to encourage critical thought or take the opportunity to discuss an issue in greater depth.

The American population is rapidly becoming more diverse and less homogeneous in every sphere, and that change is occurring from the bottom of the demographic charts upward. In other words, there are a lot more non-white, non-WASP, minorities people in the younger age brackets than the older. Ergo, instead of having to navigate one white monoculture that everyone else is expected to conform to, Professors are now forced for confront how their own behavior might have contributed to forms of casual racism. They’re beginning to get pushback.

In other words, a lot of this moral panic about “overly sensitive” students sounds a lot like the older generation whining about having their behavior suddenly policed by a population they are used to dictating to.

Given his lack of actual harms done to himself, ultimately it very thinly veiled whine by a white man who was afraid of the prospect of having to listen to perspectives other than his own scapegoating his students about institutional problems.

## Problems in Academia


Schlosser isn't entirely wrong, however. There are serious pressures that Professors and Universities are facing. But they're not from their students.

The University is increasingly treating professors as a disposable commodity and college like a consumer product. He has no job security. He keeps talking about adjuncts getting axed for literally anything. Adjuncts are incredibly replaceable. They're part of an exploitative system.

Picture this: every year, Universities accept more Graduate Students than there will realistically be teaching positions for. Why? [Because they can pay the Grad Students next to nothing to proctor a section](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/15/why-are-we-scapegoating-college-kids.html).

Then, when the Grad Students get their degrees, the now flooded job market means that Universities can staff themselves almost exclusively with Adjunct and Part Time Faculty. Those members will almost certainly never get tenure, and will likely be fired before their salary bracket increases. Meanwhile, Administrative costs at Universities are ballooning, with Chancellor pay beginning to mirror CEO pay.

This problem gets worse every year.

Bur for Lukianoff and Schlosser, demonizing black 19 year olds is easy. It panders to the emotions of baby boomers who are uncomfortable with shifting demographics. Dealing with the serious problems in College and Academia requires nuance and research, and doesn’t generate the outrage that drives the ad revenue on their articles.

Even today, it’s conservatives who are first to call for censorship in education rather than those on the left. When an elementary school librarian dares to stock a book with a gay couple in it, conservatives are quick to demand it be removed. When a middle school teacher wants to teach kids comprehensive sex education, conservatives demand censorship and an abstinence-only based program consistent with their religion.

Conservatives demand that entire textbooks be censored to remove references to the history of the labor movement, global warming, evolution, and numerous other things to comply with conservative dogma. Indeed, it has been very well documented that Texas state standards for Textbooks are essentially forced on other states in the country, [because publishers want to cater to Texas, one of their largest markets](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/jun/21/how-texas-inflicts-bad-textbooks-on-us/).

Yet these problems are almost never called out by “Free Speech” advocates.

## The Tone of the Internet


There’s one point about the general tone of American discourse that “Free Speech” advocates make that’s worth addressing. People seem to have become much more comfortable registering complaints and joining brigades than they are in talking to the person with which they have the problem.

I think a big aspect of it is the way our media today tends to thrive on outrage. Everyone, from big media corporations all the way down to people who just blog and tweet sometimes, has figured out that the real way to get people to click through a link, or to retweet what you've said, or to stop changing the channels is to appeal to people's sense of righteous indignation.

Take a look at how I advertised this article on Facebook. I deliberately listed a ton of hot-button issues that people are talking about this week. And it worked. You’re reading this now.

Pay attention to the stuff that's trending on Twitter, or the headlines that seem most popular. A huge portion of them seem designed to evoke their readers' outrage. But when nearly every headline you saw during your formative years is essentially conveying the message “you wouldn't believe the ridiculous thing [liberals|conservatives|white people|black people|rich people|poor people|<other identifiable group>] did!” you start to think that being in a state of constant outrage is normal.

It has essentially eliminated the "mild annoyance" step of hearing things you disagree with. Very few things are written with a tone of mild annoyance, they're always written with a screeching, over-the-top, I-can't-believe-they-did-this tone. People don't know how to just be annoyed at something they disagree with anymore. It's agreement or outrage.

And it's a scary trend. It basically makes it so that everyone's baseline is a state of anger, so it's much easier for things to boil over into violence. It shuts down discussion, but a more insidious effect is that actual toxic attitudes like racism can get more of a foothold because there isn't any actual discussion that might convince someone that racism is wrong, it's just either outright dismissal, or a screeching confrontation when it pops up.

From Gamergate to Janet Jackson, this works in Conservative Reactionary circles as often as it does in Liberal Progressive ones.

It is not a college problem. It is not an ideological problem. It is an American problem.



* * *



The controversies are the same: left-wing students seizing power from the adults, letting their unconventional political views get in the way of their education and the people who know best! Their goals are also explicitly feminist and their spokespeople usually young women, a combination essentially guaranteed to bring mostly white, male, and older people out to tell them that they’re being young and wrong.

It’s boring to talk about tenure, about rising tuition, about how graduate students are exploited, about ballooning administration costs. When you talk about those things, only people directly in academia tend to take notice. But when you talk about trigger warnings, it starts to trend on Twitter. People with no stake whatsoever in academia will start to loudly voice their opinions.

A Free Speech society, in theory, is one in which every member is allowed to express themselves from a position of equal social authority. The idea is that we can all share what we think and reach a consensus with everyone, regardless of status, having a say in that consensus. It is essentially the foundation of a democratic society.

When we use our speech to threaten people, or to insult broad groups, we are not upholding our own right to free speech but rather we are undermining that person's or that group's access to free speech. Speech of this nature creates an environment of fear in which certain members of society must limit what they say or else face consequences. This runs directly contrary to the environment that free speech laws are intended to foster.

People who behave this way are not the proud, staunch defenders of free speech that they claim to be. They are selfish, ruthless free-riders who use their own voices to ensure that others are not heard. They exploit the letter of the law to violate its spirit.

The legal right of people to voice their racist and bigoted views isn't in dispute. It never has been.

Instead, Conservatives are using "Free Speech" as a red herring to try and silence people who use their own speech to fight against hateful conduct.
