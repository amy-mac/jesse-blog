I wake up and see many people more outraged over rioting than the monstrous miscarriage of justice that has occurred. It reminds me of the Occupy Movement, and the "outrage" over camps set up in downtown San Francisco and Oakland.

People go to sleep hungry every day, even within walking distance of where we live. We pass cold and broken people on the street without looking at them. We see the makeshift tents where they live and don't give them a second thought. During Occupy, the unforgivable sin was putting that suffering, which we can comfortably compartmentalize and not think about during the day, and juxtaposing it with the affluent successes and excesses of our world. People hated Occupy because it forced them to actively consider the harsh truths about our system.

The same thing is happening with the rioting in Ferguson. Most people are content to not acknowledge the systemic violence that black people experience on a regular basis. They are content to shunt it away to something that happens to "others" in the "ghettos." Again, the unforgivable sin to many people in America isn't the fact that the violence, or the racism, or the iniquity happens; the thing that most bothers people is actually having to see it.
