Science and technology do improve our quality of life, but without good public policy to guide them, their benefits are largely localized to the elite, and they largely further the acceleration of inequality. I didn't march for better science, because hello, we've got that, I'm typing this on a tiny pocket supercomputer. Instead I marched for the better application of policy to technological advances, so the benefits of them can be fairly applied to everyone.
