His first weekend in the White House, Donald Trump was visited by the ghost of George Washington. Donald asked him, "George, what can I do to best serve the United States?"

The ghost of George Washington responded, "Never tell a lie."

Donald said, "Oh, I don't think I can do that. I'm sending Sean Spicer out to say that 3 million fraudulent votes were cast in the election."

The next weekend, he was visited by the ghost of Thomas Jefferson. He asked him, "Thomas, what can I do to best serve the United States?"

The ghost of Thomas Jefferson responded, “Preserve the separation of Church and State.”

Donald said, "Oh, I don't think I can do that. I have to cut funding for family planning and ban Muslims from entering the United States."

I have a prediction for next weekend...

When Donald Trump is visited by the ghost of Abraham Lincoln next weekend, and Trump asks how to best serve the United States, Lincoln will feel compelled to respond, "Go to the theater."
