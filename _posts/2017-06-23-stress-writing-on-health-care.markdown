What's the purpose of civil society and civilization, of government and politics? It ought not to just be to protect the powerful. In the last several hundred years in the West has come the notion that it's to provide enough for everyone. We produce enough water for everyone to drink and food for everyone to eat and have seconds. We have more empty housing than homeless.

What about health care? Sure, 200 years ago there weren't many doctors. But now? The American Medical Association turns away hundreds of candidates for Medical school who have perfect grades and MCAT scores. We pay hundreds of dollars to buy pills that take cents to produce, all to provide a third yacht to CEOs.

Health care is every bit as much of a right as food and shelter. Our society easily has the capacity to do it. There's plenty of room for reasonable debate about how we should do it; that's just politics. But at this moment, the discussion appears to be, "Do we let the poor die premature deaths even though we can afford to care for them?"

Many of the questions we're facing aren't in the normal variance of a society protecting people. The people who think we ought to not have a civilization are trying to dismantle it.
