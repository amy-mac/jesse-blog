!["Happy Black History Month! Or as we'll probably hear from the White House, Happy The Irish Were Slaves Too Month!"](/images/2017/black-history.jpg)

And every time you see a white person post that damn Morgan Freeman clip again take a shot.

No wait nothing will get done that way. Ask them if they know why Carter Woodson started the precursor to it to begin with. Or why February was chosen.

Educate them about the historical erasure of African Americans from American historical narratives. Inform them that Texas, one of the most influential textbook markets in the country, pushes standards that marginalized the teaching of slavery in their curriculum.

And if someone goes full "all lives matter" and you have to be snarky, ask if they can explain who Marcus Garvey was.
