I've completed my transition from Reddit to Twitter as my primary news aggregator. (Reddit's altered algorithm and infiltration by white supremacists spurred this decision.) In the aftermath of the 2016 election, I sought to expand my "bubble," and diversify the people I was following.

This meant an ideological diversification, and following several libertarians and conservatives. I don't agree with their conclusions, but they tend to be rooted in reality, and make their arguments in good faith.

I have also endeavored to achieve gender parity in the people I follow, and have sought out to follow more people of color, more queer and trans people, and to follow people of more diverse faiths, including Muslims.

So, there we have it. I'm trying to pop my bubble. And my earnest hope is that the people urging leftists to do the former are attempting to do the latter themselves.
