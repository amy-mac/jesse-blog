Today on the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump once again raised the possibility of electoral fraud in November.

Let's take a moment to remember who runs our elections: the individual States do. There's a position that we vote for every four years, mostly called the Secretary of State. There is no relation to the Federal position; the SoS in the various states tend to be tasked with record keeping, and administering elections.

And what do you know, being an elected position, a simple Google search will show you who they are in each state. Currently, 28 of the 50 states have a Republican serving in this position (or its equivalent).

So when Hillary Clinton inevitably wins in most of the following states and Donald Trump cries foul, remember these names:

<ul class="list--no-bullet">
  <li>Arizona - Michele Reagan, R</li>
  <li>Colorado - Wayne W. Williams, R</li>
  <li>Florida - Ken Detzner, R</li>
  <li>Georgia - Brian Kemp, R</li>
  <li>Iowa - Paul Pate, R</li>
  <li>Michigan - Ruth Johnson, R</li>
  <li>Mississippi - Delbert Hosemann, R</li>
  <li>Nevada - Barbara K. Cegavske, R</li>
  <li>New Mexico - Brad Winter, R</li>
  <li>Ohio - Jon Husted, R</li>
  <li>South Carolina - Mark Hammond, R</li>
  <li>Texas - Carlos H. Cascos, R</li>
</ul>

So when the inevitable conspiracy theories start rolling around about a stolen election, remember that the Democratic Party would have to somehow gain the complicity of a dozen of these lifelong Republicans.
