I've always been amused by the purely semantic argument against Feminism; the notion that because we have nominally equal political rights there is no need for the movement, or that Feminists must want societal privileges at the expense of men.

Imagine if there were a group of people who excoriated the Democrats and Republicans for their name. "We vote in democratic elections," they would say. "We have a Republican system of government. There's no need to give your movement that name!"

But of course such an argument would be ridiculous. Because we have those institutions doesn't mean that our government fairly and equally represents everyone. And just because we've made important strides towards equality in the last century doesn't mean that there isn't still a long way to go.
