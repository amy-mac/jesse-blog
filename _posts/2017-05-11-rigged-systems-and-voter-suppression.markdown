Hey everyone: life is about to hand you a rare gift today. Pay attention.

Today Trump is expected to create a "Presidential Commission on Election Integrity." He will claim that it is needed because there is widespread voter fraud. What he won't mention is that most documented cases of voter fraud come from conservatives attempting to prove how supposedly easy it to fraudulently vote. It's a virtually nonexistent problem that uniquely burdens lower income and minority voters.

Wisconsin has strict voter ID laws that disenfranchised 200,000-300,000 people, leading to a 13% decline in turnout among key Democratic constituencies. Trump won the state by 20,000 votes.

Wow! That all sounds really grim. Where's my gift?

The word of the year in 2016 was "rigged." Rigged elections, rigged Primaries, and on and on. Well here is as clear a case of election rigging as you can possibly get. Disenfranchisement, as well as gerrymandering, has been a key strategy for the GOP in certain states. Now they're taking it national!

Here's as clear a test as life can possibly give the politicians and pundits you follow, or hell even the politically active private citizens in your life. If someone has spent the last 18 months talking about a rigged system and yet doesn't speak up about voter suppression? That's as clear a sign as life can give you that such a person is completely full of shit.
