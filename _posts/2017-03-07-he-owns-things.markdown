For a people that claim to value a strong work ethic, Americans tend to really value the notion that you get to live a life of luxury while performing no labor if you have just the right pieces of paper in your desk drawer.

"What does he do?"

"He owns things!"

"Okay, but what does he do!"

"He owns things, and sometimes he owns brand new things!"

"So does he actually go and build the buildings?"

"No his workers do that. He OWNS things."

"Oh. So he designs what the workers build?"

"No, his architects and engineers do that. What part of 'he owns things' don't you get?"

"So he must manage allocating the resources to do all that then?"

"No, he hires accountants and managers to do all that. Look, owning things is valuable okay?"

"Valuable to whom?"

"To the people who own them."

"So why do the rest of us supply him with all these luxuries while everyone else does all the actual work?"

"LOOK. HE. OWNS. THINGS. WHAT PART OF THAT DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?" *starts sobbing*
