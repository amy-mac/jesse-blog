Every few years, someone asks me for recommendations of a few episodes of the original Star Trek series to watch.

The truth is that the original isn’t as consistent a product as the future entries in the franchise. Some episodes are just plain bad; this is particularly true in the third season, when the budget was slashed, and many key writers and production staff left the show.

In addition, the original Trek was produced in an anthology format. It is exceedingly rare that there is a reference to the events of a previous episode. In large part, Trek was green lit because of the success of anthology shows such as The Twilight Zone, which had been hugely successful during syndication. Therefore Star Trek was designed to make sense out of order or incomplete.

Finally, many elements of the original Star Trek were dropped entirely from the spinoffs. Hodgkin's Law of Parallel Planetary Development held that there were not only many planets that evolved humans, but also held that those planets would have recognizable human cultures. That is gone entirely in The Next Generation. Further, in the original series, there are androids aplenty; in TNG, they make a big deal about how unique Data is as an artificial life form. Finally, in Turnabout Intruder, Janice Lester bemoans that she was excluded as a starship captain because of her gender. However, four films later we see Madge Sinclair playing the Captain of the Saratoga; and in Enterprise, we see Erika Hernandez as the Captain of the Columbia, almost a century before Kirk’s adventures.

So the breakdown of episodes and the order to watch them accomplish the following: they remove the episodes that are just hard to watch. They maintain as much consistency with the franchise as a whole as is possible. And it distinguishes between the fun non-Jesse-canon episodes, and the episodes that should just be thrown out.

## Romulan Ale


_These episodes are as fun as a Tribble in a Klingon engine room. They are exactly what people think of when they talk about how “campy” the Original Series is. I don’t consider them canon, but on a Friday night they go great with the psychoactive compound of your choice._

Shore Leave – _The amusement park planet!_
The Squire of Gothos – _Q Senior!_
Who Mourns for Adonais? - _Kirk vs. a Greek God_
Wolf in the Fold – _Scotty vs. Jack the Ripper_
Bread and Circuses – _The Roman planet!_
A Piece of the Action – _The Al Capone planet!_
Patterns of Force – _The Nazi planet!_
Spectre of the Gun – _The Wild West planet!_
The Savage Curtain – _Abe Lincoln vs. Klingons_

_Season 2:_ Friday's Child, The Apple, The Deadly Years, The Immunity Syndrome, Return to Tomorrow

_Season 3:_ Is There in Truth No Beauty?, For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky, The Mark of Gideon

However you chose to watch Star Trek, remember this: no one gets to tell you how to relate to the text. Any text. You can watch anything backwards, sideways, out of order. This is all just a distillation of my opinions on episode quality and canon. A very gentle suggestion. Just go out and watch some Trek.
