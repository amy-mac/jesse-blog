The Confederate States of America was fundamentally built upon the institution of Slavery.

According to Alexander Stephens, the Vice President of the Confederacy:


<blockquote>Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.</blockquote>


Indeed, this was borne out in the Constitution of the Confederacy:


<blockquote>Article I, Section 2, Paragraph 3: Slaves will be counted as 3/5ths of a person for the purposes of apportioning representation and taxes.
Article I, Section 9, Paragraph 1: The African slave trade remains prohibited.
Article I, Section 9, Paragraph 2: Congress can ban the import of slaves from territories external to the Confederacy.
Article I, Section 9, Paragraph 4: No law impairing the right of property in Negro slaves shall be passed.
Article IV, Section 2, Paragraph 1: The citizens of the CSA will have the right to travel and live in any state in the Confederacy, and be granted the rights granted to all Confederate citizens while within the borders of the Confederacy, including the right to their property in slaves which shall not be impaired.
Article IV, Section 2, Paragraph 3: No slave can be discharged from their labor by escaping and must be returned to their owner.
Article IV, Section 3, Paragraph 3: In the event of expansion of the Confederacy's borders, the right to slavery will be extended into all territory claimed by the Confederacy.</blockquote>


Note that a majority of these articles are nowhere to be found in the American Constitution. The only other significant differences in the two documents are that the President is elected for a six year term, and has a line-item veto.

The South fought in the Civil War to “preserve” the institution of Slavery, which is in itself utterly laughable. Let’s look at a simple chronology:

6 November, 1860 - Election of Abraham Lincoln as President of United States
20 December 1860 - South Carolina secedes from the Union
9 February 1861 - The Confederate States of America is formed
4 March 1861 - Abraham Lincoln is sworn in as President
8 March 1861 - Confederate Congress calls for an Army of 100,000
12-13 April 1861: The Confederacy attacks a “Union” installation, Fort Sumter, South Carolina
15 April 1861 - Lincoln calls for 75,000 volunteers

Wow, looks like they sure had to defend themselves there! The Northern Aggression of… a democratic election.

To put it bluntly, the Confederate Battle Flag stands for aggressively and preemptively murdering fellow Americans in defense of keeping Black Americans in ruthless bondage. The fact that so many people in the United States today view it as a source of pride is something that should cause us nothing but the bitterest shame. And if you want to throw up the entirely discredited notions of “states rights” or “heritage,” I will stand an inch from your fucking nose and tell you why you’re the worst kind of fool.
